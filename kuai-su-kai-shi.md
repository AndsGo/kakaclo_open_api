{% hint style="warning" %}
**Good to know:** A quick start guide can be good to help folks get up and running with your API in a few steps. Some people prefer diving in with the basics rather than meticulously reading every page of documentation!

## **API endpoint**

After you get your **Access-Token**, it's very easy to start making API call to Shoplazzaa.All endpoints are only accessible via HTTPS and are located at&#x20;
